### Objective
Our project focuses on bringing explainability in diagnosis of Alzhemierâ€™s Disease (AD). We believe that building trust in diagnostic models is a crucial step in increasing the adoption of AI in medical fields. We also want to explore how using multi-modal data such as clinical assessments, MRI & PET scans, and biomarkers can affect diagnosis accuracy.
